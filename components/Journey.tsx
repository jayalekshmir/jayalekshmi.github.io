          with over
          <span className="italic font-bold"> 8+ years </span> of experience,
          specializing in frontend technologies. I am passionate about creating
          innovative, user-centric applications that address real-world
          challenges and elevate digital experiences. With a strong expertise in
          modern frameworks, a collaborative approach, and a dedication to
          writing clean, scalable code, I consistently aim to deliver
          high-quality solutions within Agile environments. I am now seeking a full-time opportunity where I can make meaningful contributions, continue my professional growth, and be part of a forward-thinking team.

I am currently seeking opportunities in software development and am available for an immediate start with full working rights in New Zealand.

I bring over 8 years of experience in full-stack development, primarily working with the MERN stack. My frontend expertise includes React, Next.js, Vue (Nuxt.js), and Angular, while on the backend I have experience with Node.js, Java, and basic Python.

If you’re aware of any suitable opportunities or could kindly guide me in the right direction, I would truly appreciate your support.

Thank you very much for your time.
