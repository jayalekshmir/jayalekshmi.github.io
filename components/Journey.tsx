          I am currently working as a Packaged App Development Specialist with
          over 7 years of experience, specializing in frontend technologies. I
          am passionate about creating innovative, user-centric applications
          that address real-world challenges and elevate digital experiences.
          With a strong expertise in modern frameworks, a collaborative
          approach, and a dedication to writing clean, scalable code, I
          consistently aim to deliver high-quality solutions within Agile
          environments. I am in the process of obtaining my work visa and plan
          to relocate to New Zealand by September 2025. I am actively seeking a
          full-time opportunity where I can make meaningful contributions,
          continue my professional growth, and be part of a forward-thinking
          team
